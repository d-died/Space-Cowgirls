MVP:
-As a user, I should be explained the setting, story, and concept of the game before starting. 

-As a user, I should be able to choose between 3 different ships with preset and varying speed & attack. 
-After selecting a ship, as a user, I will encounter 4 different ships over the course of the story. 
-Each enemy ship will have (randomly generated) attack and speed values. 
-As a user, I will have the choice to either "attack" or "run" from the enemy:
  -If user chooses to attack:
     -As a user, if I choose to attack a ship that has a lower attack score, I will win (a percentage or set number) of their health and all of their loot. 
     -As a user, if I choose to attack a ship that has a higher attack score, I will lose (a percentage or set number) of my health and loot. 
  -If user chooses to run:
     -As a user, if I choose to run from a ship that has a higher speed value, I will lose a lower (percentage or set number) value of health/loot. 
     -As a user, if I choose to run from a ship that has a lower speed value, I will walk away unscathed. 
  -As a user, I will be able to see the result of my selection: +/- health, +/- loot.
  -As a user, this action will happen for each ship. 

There are 3 possible outcomes for the game:
-As a user, the game will end if ship's health value drops to 0. 
   -As a user, I will be shown "GAME OVER".
-As a user, the game will end if health value remains above 0 and all ships are cleared. 
   -As a user, I will be shown "YOU SURVIVED".
-As a user, the game will end if you acquire (over a certain amount of) loot after all 4 ships.
   -As a user, I will be shown "YOU THRIVED".
